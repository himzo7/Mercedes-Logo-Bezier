<h1 align="center"> Mercedes-Benz | Digital Craftsmanship</h1>

This project is a technical demonstration of different web rendering technologies using the iconic Mercedes-Benz identity. It explores the practical differences between SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), HTML5 Canvas, and traditional Raster PNG images, focusing on clarity, scalability, and performance optimization.

## Live Demo

You can view the live project here: [Mercedes-Benz Demo](https://vash-username.github.io/ime-repozitorija/) (hosted on GitHub Pages).
*Note: Ensure you have a modern browser for the best experience with smooth scroll animations and the interactive comparison slider.*

## Features

- **Rendering Comparison**: A side-by-side look at SVG, Canvas, and PNG technologies.
- **Interactive Clarity Slider**: A real-time comparison tool (split-view) that allows users to zoom in and see the "infinite" sharpness of vectors versus the pixelation of raster images.
- **Technical Code Reveal**: Integrated code snippets for each rendering method to understand the underlying implementation (XML vs. JavaScript vs. HTML).
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses `IntersectionObserver` for smooth scroll reveals, `lazy-loading` for high-res imagery, and GPU-accelerated CSS transitions to prevent stuttering.
- **Responsive Luxury Design**: A dark-themed, premium UI inspired by Mercedes-Benz aesthetics.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and Canvas API.
- **CSS3**: Advanced layouts (Grid, Flexbox), Clip-paths for the slider, and hardware-accelerated animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactive slider logic, programmatic Canvas drawing, and scroll-reveal observers.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the page.
- `style.css`: All visual styling, including the luxury dark theme and animations.
- `script.js`: Interactive logic (Canvas drawing, Slider, Scroll animations).
- `mercedes.png`: Sample raster file for comparison.
